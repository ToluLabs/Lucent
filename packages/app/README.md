# @lucent/app — Lucent front-end

The Next.js product front-end for [Lucent](../../README.md): landing, docs,
and about pages, plus the app itself —

- **`/shield`** — deposit public XLM into a confidential balance, merge
  receiving into spendable, withdraw back out.
- **`/send`** — confidential transfer to any registered account.
- **`/payroll`** — employer: create a template, open/fund/execute a run;
  employee: claim.
- **`/escrow`** — create/fund an escrow and drive it through its state
  machine (mark-completed, release, dispute, resolve, timeout, refund).
- **`/auditor`** — decrypt every transfer amount with the registered
  Grumpkin auditor key. No wallet needed.
- **`/prove`** — selective disclosure, both sides: prove a transfer (holder)
  and verify a returned bundle (receiver, no wallet needed).
- **`/profile`** — wallet identity, protocol info, disconnect.

All screens (except `/auditor` and the verify side of `/prove`) require a
connected Varial wallet and redirect to `/` if none is connected. Every
proof-carrying action (register, withdraw, send, payroll execute, escrow
fund) generates its UltraHonk proof **in the browser** via bb.js and shows a
progress state immediately on tap.

The orchestration (prover cache, Varial signing, every on-chain operation)
lives in `lib/wallet.ts` — a `ConfidentialWallet` class over
[`@lucent/sdk`](../sdk/README.md) — shared across the app through
`lib/wallet-context.tsx`.

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

`predev`/`prebuild` build `@lucent/sdk` first automatically — it's a
workspace package the app imports from its compiled `dist/`, not from
source.

The confidential `sk` is derived deterministically from a Varial `signMessage` signature over a deployment-bound message (Ed25519 signatures are deterministic, so the key is recoverable on any device and useless on other deployments), then cached in `localStorage` — a production wallet would store it encrypted.

## Event history & the indexer

Balances are reconstructed in the browser from chain events and persisted in `localStorage` (the SDK's `StateEngine` — see [State reconstruction & retention](../sdk/README.md#state-reconstruction--retention) for the mechanics and why local persistence is load-bearing). The Soroban RPC only retains ~7 days of history, so the app reads from a hybrid source: RPC for the recent tail, and an optional Goldsky indexer for older history.

Point the app at a deployed indexer to get full history:

```bash
# packages/app/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL=https://confidential-token-indexer.<account>.workers.dev
```

Unset, the app runs **RPC-only**: events older than the ~7-day window are unavailable, so a fresh client must **sync at least once per retention period** or an aged-out incoming-transfer opening becomes unrecoverable. See [`@lucent/indexer`](../indexer/README.md) to deploy one.

## Cross-origin isolation

Browser proving needs `window.crossOriginIsolated === true` (SharedArrayBuffer, used by bb.js's Web Worker). The app sets `COOP: same-origin` + `COEP: credentialless` in `next.config.mjs`. `credentialless` (not `require-corp`) is intentional: it lets the RPC `fetch` through without needing CORS headers on the Stellar testnet endpoint.

## Deploy

The app deploys to **Cloudflare Workers** via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (`pnpm deploy:app`, config in `wrangler.jsonc`). Next builds with the `--webpack` flag — the bb.js handling below is webpack-specific.

## Critical: bb.js must never be webpack-bundled

bb.js's pre-built browser bundle declares a top-level `__webpack_exports__` that collides with webpack's own module runtime, and it spawns its wasm Web Worker via `new Worker(new URL('./main.worker.js', import.meta.url))` (marked `webpackIgnore`) — so once bundled into a hashed `_next` chunk the worker can't be found and proving hangs forever (you'll see a blank page or a silent hang).

The fix is already in place:

1. `scripts/vendor-bb.mjs` (run by `predev`/`prebuild`) copies bb.js's `dest/browser/` into `public/vendor/bb/` (git-ignored, regenerated each build).
2. The webpack client config aliases the bare `@aztec/bb.js` specifier to `false`.
3. `lib/bb-loader.ts` overrides the SDK's `setUltraHonkBackendLoader` to import `/vendor/bb/index.js` as **native ESM** from that stable path at runtime. The loader's `new Function` must stay lazy — Cloudflare Workers forbid eval at the top level.

## Tester analytics

See [the analytics setup and recruitment guide](../../ANALYTICS.md). Collection is off by default, enabled only for the configured HTTPS production hostname. Public settings and the notice live at `/privacy`. Never add a second automatic tracker snippet or send wallet/payment data to analytics.

## Wallet branding

Varial is the new name for Freighter. The integration continues to use
`@stellar/freighter-api`; the adapter file and internal function names retain
the SDK name. The deployment-bound key-derivation message and storage keys
remain unchanged so this branding update does not change confidential keys.
