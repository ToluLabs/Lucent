            Lucent is a confidential payments layer built on Stellar. It lets you send, receive, run
            payroll, and lock escrow while keeping every amount hidden on-chain — visible to no one
            except the parties you authorize, not even validators.
          </P>
          <Callout>
            <strong>Not production ready.</strong> The UltraHonk verifier backend and the circuits are
            unaudited, and the escrow custody model carries a documented trust caveat (see Encrypted
            Escrow, below). Lucent runs on Stellar testnet only — do not use it with real value.
          </Callout>
          <H3>The trust model</H3>
          <P>
            Lucent doesn&apos;t rely on trusted relayers or off-chain custody. Privacy comes from
            zero-knowledge proofs generated in your browser and verified natively by Stellar&apos;s
            Protocol 26 host functions. There is no operator key that could be compromised, and no
            bridge holding your funds.
          </P>
          <H3>The privacy model</H3>
          <P>
            Lucent encrypts <em>amounts only</em>. Counterparty addresses remain fully public, so
            on-chain auditability is preserved — you can verify that a payment moved from wallet A to
            wallet B without knowing how much. That is the right trade-off for payments and payroll:
            the <em>who</em> is public; the <em>how much</em> is private.
          </P>
          <P>
            Every balance is a Pedersen commitment on the Grumpkin curve, <Code>C = v·G + r·H</Code>.
            The network only ever sees commitments and the UltraHonk proofs that the arithmetic behind
            them is correct — no plaintext amount ever appears in a transaction, event, or contract
            state entry.
          </P>

          <H2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</H2>
          <P>
            Every confidential account holds a <strong>spendable</strong> balance (what you can send or
            withdraw) and a <strong>receiving</strong> balance (where deposits and incoming transfers
            land). A <Code>merge</Code> folds receiving into spendable — a homomorphic point addition
            that needs no proof.
          </P>
          <Pre>{`register    proof  Bind your Grumpkin keys to the contract (one-time)
deposit     —      Public USDC -> your receiving balance
merge       —      Fold receiving -> spendable
withdraw    proof  Spendable -> public USDC
transfer    proof  Spendable -> another account's receiving balance`}</Pre>
          <P>
            Every transfer also emits dual auditor ciphertexts — one for the sender&apos;s channel, one
            for the recipient&apos;s — so the registered auditor key can decrypt every amount without
            either party&apos;s cooperation.
          </P>

          <H2 id="deposit-withdraw">Deposit & Withdraw</H2>
          <H3>Register (one-time)</H3>
          <P>
            Before any of this, <strong>Shield</strong> derives a Grumpkin key set deterministically from
            a Freighter message signature — the same keys every session, nothing extra to back up — and
            proves ownership of it with a zero-knowledge proof that binds the key set to your Stellar
            address on the token contract. This happens once per account; every confidential operation
            below depends on it having already happened.
          </P>
          <H3>Deposit</H3>
          <P>
            Go to <strong>Shield</strong> and deposit. This moves public USDC into your confidential
            receiving balance at a 1:1 ratio — no proof required, since the deposit commitment has zero
            blinding. The deposit amount is a public plaintext <Code>i128</Code> in USDC base units
            (7 decimals, so 1 USDC = 10,000,000 base units). Merge it into spendable before sending or
            withdrawing.
          </P>
          <P>
            Spendable and receiving are shown as two separate numbers deliberately: a deposit (or an
            incoming transfer) counts as yours the moment it lands, but it isn&apos;t spendable or
            withdrawable until you merge it in.
          </P>
          <H3>Withdraw</H3>
          <P>
            Withdrawing is a two-step, in-browser flow: a withdraw proof is generated locally (this
            takes a few seconds — you&apos;re proving &quot;I can open this commitment to a value at
            most my balance&quot; without revealing the balance itself), then submitted on-chain. The
            Soroban verifier checks the proof and converts your spendable balance back into public USDC.
          </P>

          <H2 id="private-payments">Private Payments</H2>
          <P>
            Go to <strong>Send</strong>, choose a registered recipient, and enter an amount. A transfer
            proof is generated in your browser and submitted with the transaction — the recipient
            address is visible on-chain; the amount is not.
          </P>
          <H3>Why only registered recipients</H3>
          <P>
            Building the transfer proof requires the recipient&apos;s public viewing key (
            <Code>PVK</Code>), which only exists on-chain once they&apos;ve completed the one-time
            register step themselves. Send only lists addresses the app has already seen register — an
            address with no <Code>PVK</Code> has nowhere for the proof to encrypt an amount into.
          </P>
          <H3>What the proof actually proves</H3>
          <P>
            <Code>confidential_transfer</Code> proves, without revealing any of the three numbers
            involved: &quot;I know the opening of my spendable commitment, it covers at least this
            amount, and here are two new commitments — one for what I&apos;m sending and one for what
            stays in my own balance.&quot; The proof also seals the amount into two ciphertexts, one per
            auditor channel (sender&apos;s and recipient&apos;s), so a registered auditor can decrypt it
            later even though no one else can.
          </P>
          <P>
            The sent amount lands in the recipient&apos;s receiving balance, not spendable — same as a
            deposit, they merge it in whenever they like.
          </P>

          <H2 id="payroll">Confidential Payroll</H2>
          <P>
            <strong>PayrollVault</strong> is an orchestrator, not a custodian: an employer creates a
            template of employees and opens a run. Salaries never touch chain storage — at execution
            the employer&apos;s browser proves one confidential transfer per employee, and the vault
            routes them atomically. No employee can read another&apos;s salary, and the vault itself
            never sees a plaintext amount either.
          </P>

          <H3>Employer flow</H3>
          <P>
            <strong>Create a template</strong> once with the employee list — templates carry no
            amounts, just who gets paid. <strong>Create a run</strong> against it to open a{" "}
            <Code>Scheduled</Code> run. <strong>Confirm the run</strong> (<Code>fund_run</Code> on-chain
            — the app calls it "Confirm" since it doesn't actually move anything) records that the
            employer&apos;s confidential spendable balance covers the total — a state marker, not a
            transfer, since the vault can&apos;t read an encrypted balance to lock anything against it.
          </P>
          <P>
            <strong>Execute the run</strong> is where the money actually moves: the employer enters each
            salary, and the browser builds one transfer proof per employee, chained — employee 2&apos;s
            proof spends the balance opening left over after employee 1&apos;s, and so on, so the whole
            batch is internally consistent. All proofs submit in one transaction; the vault runs every
            transfer and only marks the run <Code>Executed</Code> if all of them succeed — no partial
            payroll runs. A <Code>Scheduled</Code> run can be cancelled any time before execution.
          </P>
          <H3>Employee flow</H3>
          <P>
            A paid employee sees the salary appear in their receiving balance and merges it into
            spendable with <strong>Claim</strong>, same <Code>merge</Code> as anywhere else — no proof
            needed.
          </P>
          <H3>Compliance</H3>
          <P>
            Every salary transfer is an ordinary <Code>confidential_transfer</Code>, so it carries the
            same dual auditor ciphertexts as a Send. Register the employer as the deployment&apos;s
            auditor and every salary they&apos;ve ever paid becomes decryptable to them on the Auditor
            screen — while each employee still only ever sees their own.
          </P>

          <H2 id="escrow">Encrypted Escrow</H2>
          <P>
            <strong>PrivateEscrow</strong> is custodial, unlike Payroll: the funds actually need to sit
            somewhere confidential between funding and release, and a confidential balance only exists
            at a contract address, so each escrow deploys its own tiny instance contract just to hold
            it — its own confidential account, isolated from every other escrow&apos;s.

            configurable per-escrow. Both deadlines are enforced by the contract itself, not the app —
            calling an action before its deadline simply reverts on-chain. The Escrow screen shows a live
            countdown to whichever deadline currently applies, and disables the corresponding action
            (Timeout Refund / Claim / Dispute) until it actually opens, so there&apos;s no guessing at
            when a call will succeed.

          <H3>Funding and payout validation</H3>
          <P>
            Funding is the expensive step, proof-wise — the depositor derives a one-time Grumpkin
            identity for the instance itself and builds four proofs: a register proof for that identity,
            a transfer-in proof (depositor → instance), and — because the instance can never generate a
            proof on its own later — both possible payout proofs up front, instance → recipient and
            instance → depositor. At roughly 14KB each, all four together exceed what fits in one
            Soroban transaction. Four wallet confirmations prepare the inputs, verify each payout, and fund:

          <P>
            <Code>fund</Code> requires both payout proofs to have passed verification against the exact
            prepared funding commitment. Replacing the funding inputs clears both approvals. Funds
            move only in the last call; a rejected proof leaves the escrow unfunded. Once funding completes, the depositor discards the instance&apos;s one-time secret —
            see the trust caveat below.
          </P>
          <H3>Settlement</H3>
          <P>
            Every payout proof was generated once, at funding time, against a fixed opening. That&apos;s
            what lets the instance submit one of them unattended, whenever the state machine says so.
            Funding merges once, atomically; settlement never merges later deposits, so unsolicited
            credits cannot change that fixed opening. No
            one needs to be online or hold a key at settlement time. On the happy path the recipient
            marks delivery, a 10-minute release window opens, and the depositor releases. If the
            depositor stalls, the recipient either self-serves after the window (no arbiter) or escalates
            to a dispute (arbiter configured) — the arbiter resolves by state transition alone and never
            sees the amount.
          </P>
          <H3>Trust caveat</H3>
          <Callout>
            To pre-generate the two payout proofs, the depositor must derive the instance&apos;s Grumpkin
            secret at fund time. They&apos;re expected to discard it immediately afterward — a depositor
            who keeps it could re-spend the escrowed balance and invalidate both stored proofs.
            Acceptable for a testnet demo; not a production-grade custody model.

          <H2 id="disclosure">Selective Disclosure</H2>
          <P>
            The Auditor screen gives one party standing access to everything under an auditor id — the
            right tool for a compliance relationship, wrong for a one-off. Selective disclosure answers
            a narrower need: proving <em>one specific payment</em> to someone who shouldn&apos;t get a
            decrypt key to your whole history — an accountant who needs one receipt, a landlord who
            wants proof of one rent payment. It&apos;s a proof, generated and verified entirely
            off-chain — there&apos;s no on-chain disclosure verifier, the chain is only ever read from,
            never written to, for this flow.
          </P>
          <H3>Two claims</H3>
          <P>
            <strong>D-recipient</strong> — &quot;this on-chain transfer paid me exactly this
            amount.&quot; Available for anything you received; you can already decrypt it with your own
            viewing key.
          </P>
          <P>
            <strong>D-sender</strong> — &quot;I sent this on-chain transfer for exactly this
            amount.&quot; This one needs more: you re-derive the one-time ephemeral scalar your wallet
            used at send time from data still on the event itself, then prove you can reconstruct what
            the recipient decrypted. If that scalar isn&apos;t recoverable (old local state, a different
            device), the transfer isn&apos;t disclosable as a sender — your Home activity feed marks it
            accordingly.
          </P>
          <H3>How it works</H3>
          <P>
            On the <strong>Verify</strong> screen (no wallet required — this can be anyone, even someone
            with no Stellar account at all), click &quot;Create request&quot;: a fresh public key and
            nonce, generated locally, that binds whatever proof comes back to this request specifically
            so it can&apos;t be replayed against someone else. Copy the resulting JSON and send it to
            the holder however you&apos;d normally share a file.
          </P>
          <P>
            The holder pastes that JSON against the relevant transfer right in their{" "}
            <strong>Home</strong> activity feed — a &quot;Prove&quot; action sits next to any transfer
            that&apos;s disclosable. The browser generates a zero-knowledge proof bound to it — a few
            seconds of in-browser proving — and produces a bundle to copy back. Paste the bundle into
            the Verify screen to check it.
          </P>
          <H3>Why the verifier doesn&apos;t have to trust the bundle</H3>
          <P>
            The verifier never takes the holder&apos;s word for anything except the proof and one sealed
            ciphertext. It doesn&apos;t trust the bundle for who sent the transfer, who received it, or
            what the transaction even was — it re-reads the actual event from the chain by the
            bundle&apos;s event reference, re-reads the relevant account&apos;s public viewing key from
            the token contract, and re-derives every other public input from that independently-fetched
            chain state. Only then does it check the proof, and only after the proof checks out does it
            decrypt the sealed amount with the verifier&apos;s own secret key — never the holder&apos;s.
            The circuit&apos;s range and binding constraints mean a holder can&apos;t get a false amount
            past the proof by construction.
          </P>

          <H2 id="auditor">Auditor View Key</H2>
          <P>
            Every account registers under an auditor id. The holder of that Grumpkin secret key can
            decrypt every transfer amount and balance checkpoint on the <strong>Auditor</strong> screen —
            the institutional compliance primitive. Nobody else can. The screen needs no wallet: paste
            the secret into the unlock field, and it stays in page state only — never written to local
            storage, never sent anywhere, gone the moment you navigate away or reload. The app&apos;s
            shipped bundle does not contain a working default; that&apos;s deliberate, so no one gets
            auditor access just by loading the page.
          </P>
          <P>
            Once unlocked, the console fetches every transfer/withdraw event under that auditor id,
            decrypts each one, and replays the stream into a running per-account view: spendable balance
            from the sender-channel checkpoints, receiving balance as the sum of decrypted inbound
            transfers plus public deposits, folded on merge.
          </P>

            This key decrypts every confidential balance and transfer registered under auditor id 0 on
            this specific testnet deployment. There&apos;s nothing sensitive behind it — testnet, no real
            value, and the whole point of this screen is that this is what an auditor is meant to see —
            but it is real key material for a live deployment, not a placeholder. It stops applying the
            moment this stack is redeployed (a fresh random key is generated each time); check the
            Contracts section below for which deployment is current.
          </P>

          <H2 id="compliance">Compliance Policy</H2>
          <P>
            Beyond the auditor&apos;s standing visibility into amounts, the token contract carries two
            independent, on-chain-enforced compliance primitives: an <strong>allowlist policy</strong>{" "}
            and per-account <strong>freezing</strong>. Both are gated behind a single compliance admin
            address set at deploy time — nobody else can call either, and the contract enforces that
            itself rather than relying on the app to hide the buttons.
          </P>
          <P>
            <strong>Allowlist.</strong> A separate policy contract holds a simple allow/deny registry.
            When wired onto the token, every deposit, transfer, receive, and withdraw checks the policy
            first — an account not on the list is rejected on-chain, before any amount is touched. This
            is the primitive an institution needs for KYC-gated payroll: onboard employees onto the
            allowlist once, and every payroll run after that is automatically restricted to verified
            accounts, with no per-transaction compliance check outside the contract itself.
          </P>
          <P>
            <strong>Freezing.</strong> Independent of the allowlist, the compliance admin can freeze a
            specific account outright — it can no longer deposit, transfer, receive, or withdraw until
            unfrozen, regardless of allowlist status. Useful for responding to a flagged account without
            having to touch the broader allowlist.
          </P>
          <P>
            Both are managed from the <strong>Auditor</strong> screen&apos;s Compliance panel: connect
            the compliance-admin&apos;s wallet, paste an address, and allow/remove or freeze/unfreeze it.
            The panel also shows the live allowlist/frozen status for any address you check.
          </P>

          <H3>Can anyone see my balance?</H3>
          <P>
            No. Your balance is a Pedersen commitment on-chain. The plaintext openings live only in
            events, reconstructed and persisted locally by your browser&apos;s state engine — never
            broadcast in the clear.
          </P>
          <H3>Does the escrow arbiter see the locked amount?</H3>
          <P>
            No. The arbiter resolves disputes by state transition alone; the amount stays hidden through
            the entire lifecycle.
          </P>
          <H3>Auditor console vs. selective disclosure — which one do I want?</H3>
          <P>
            Auditor if you need standing, ongoing visibility into every amount under an auditor id — the
            compliance relationship Payroll is built around. Selective disclosure if you need to prove
            just one payment to one party who shouldn&apos;t get broader access — see{" "}

          </P>
          <H3>Is Lucent audited?</H3>
          <P>
            No. Lucent runs on Stellar testnet and the UltraHonk verifier and circuits are unaudited. Do
            not use it with real value.
          </P>
          <H3>What happens if I lose my wallet?</H3>
          <P>
            Confidential keys are derived deterministically from a Freighter signature, so they can be
            re-derived from the same wallet. Local balance history persisted in your browser is not
            recoverable if lost, but re-syncing from chain events reconstructs it within the RPC&apos;s
            ~7-day retention window.
